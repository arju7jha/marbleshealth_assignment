1. Home Screen:
Create a form UI that includes a dynamic component. Initially, there should be at least one instance of this component by default
Each component will consist of three elements:
Label
Info-Text
Settings

2. Dynamic Components:
Below the initial component, include an “ADD” button. When the user clicks this button, a new component should appear below the existing ones.
Each component should also have a “Remove” button. Clicking this button should remove the respective component from the form, except when only one component remains.

3. Form Submission:
At the top-right corner of the form, include a “Submit” button. When the user clicks this button, the form data should be saved and displayed, either in a dialog or printed below the form as a card.
